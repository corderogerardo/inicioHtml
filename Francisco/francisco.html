 <p> Through these pictures, it is very clear that the headphone was properly equipped by <b>Burning</b> at least at the last moments. So before accusing him of cheating, I would like to know when and under which condition those "cheating" pictures were taken, as many of you experienced dota fans may know, teams tend to remove their headphones during long pauses on LAN and have some discussions or relax a bit . So I won't call BG cheating just from what V1lat and his wife ,if I'm not wrong, were saying.</p><p>
(Edit: Thanks for the reads, guys! I would just like to add some more opinions ( pretty long, no need to read ): First of all, I'm not questioning that the "cheating" pictures are fake or what Sheever said is not right. Those pictures might as well as being taken during gameplays. But under which conditions? It could simply be that the players feel itchy after long times of wearing the soundproof headphone, and want to scratch their ears but before they can reset the headphones a teamfight happened, and then "click", pictures of "not wearing soundproof headphone during gameplay", were taken. Or it could be that the in game team talk temporarily went broken, and they have to put down one side of the headphone to hear each other. Or it could be may other cases. Or it could be that they intended to cheat. People sometimes just want to assume the worst out of other people, which I think is OK, as in real life, such suspicions protect us from potential scumbags. But can we just simply crucify others based on what we assume would be true?</p>

<h2>URL</h2>
<p>Un localizador de recursos uniforme o URL —siglas en inglés de uniform resource locator— es un identificador de recursos uniforme (URI) cuyos recursos referidos pueden cambiar, esto es, la dirección puede apuntar a recursos variables en el tiempo.1 Están formados por una secuencia de caracteres, de acuerdo a un formato modélico y estándar, que designa recursos en una red, como Internet.</p>
<p>
Los localizadores uniformes de recursos fueron una innovación en la historia de la Internet. Fueron usadas por primera vez por Tim Berners-Lee en 1991, para permitir a los autores de documentos establecer hiperenlaces en la World Wide Web. Desde 1994, en los estándares de la Internet, el concepto de URL ha sido incorporado dentro del más general de URI (Uniform Resource Identifier, en español identificador uniforme de recurso), pero el término URL aún se utiliza ampliamente.</p>
